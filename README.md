This Python code, designed for use in a Jupyter Notebook, demonstrates how to create a simple yet visually appealing checkerboard artwork using the NumPy library. NumPy's powerful array manipulation capabilities are harnessed to efficiently manage and colorize the canvas.

* If you haven't already, install the required library using pip:
pip install numpy matplotlib

* Explanation:

- Import the necessary libraries, numpy for array operations and matplotlib.pyplot for plotting the image.
- Define the desired width and height of the checkerboard image in pixels. Create a NumPy array of size (height, width, 3) and fill it with 255 (white) in each channel (RGB) to represent the background.
- Specify the size of each individual square in the checkerboard pattern and define two colors, black and white in this case, to create a classic effect.
- Use nested loops to iterate through each row (i) and column (j) of the canvas, with increments based on the square_size.
- Calculate the color index using modulo (%) to alternate between black and white based on the combined row and column index. This ensures a checkerboard pattern regardless of canvas dimensions.
Assign the corresponding color from the colors list to the current square region in the canvas array using array slicing.
- Employ plt.imshow to display the created checkerboard image in the Jupyter Notebook.
Hide the axes using plt.axis('off') for a more artistic presentation.
Call plt.show to render the final image.

* Customization:
This code provides a solid foundation. You can easily modify it to experiment with different:

-Canvas sizes: Change width and height to create larger or smaller checkerboards.
-Square sizes: Adjust square_size to create varying levels of granularity in the checkerboard pattern.
-Color palettes: Modify the colors list to incorporate different color combinations and explore artistic variations.
